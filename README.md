# C195
Project to set and retrieve info about appointments from a relational SQL database, while avoiding timezone problems. Built in Java with MySQL and JavaFX/Scenebuilder. I no longer have access to the database so this program no longer works. 
App can add Customers and their appointments, avoiding conflicts and dealing with timezones through the GUI. Views of the customers, appointments, appointments/month and appointments/week are included. Other reports are available.
Checks users' language to display some info in Spanish if necessary.
